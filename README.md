# cURL_API
How to use cURL to connect to the API and retrieve and read JSON from the API with PHP.

1. **Database Connection Script (connection.php)**:

- The script appears to use PDO (PHP Data Objects) for connecting to a PostgreSQL database, which is a secure and recommended method for interacting with databases in PHP.
- It utilizes `parse_ini_file()` to parse a configuration file (`database.ini`) containing database connection details, which allows for easier configuration management.
- Error handling is implemented using a try-catch block to catch `PDOException` exceptions, providing a graceful way to handle database connection errors.

2. **API Endpoint Script**:

- The script utilizes cURL to make an HTTP GET request to an API endpoint (`http://127.0.0.1/cURL_3/api/get_all_products/`), presumably to retrieve a list of products.
- It sets appropriate cURL options such as the request method (`GET`) and to return the response data as a string.
- Error handling is implemented to check the status of the response. If the status is 200 (indicating success), it iterates through the products and outputs their IDs and names. Otherwise, it outputs the error message.
- The script does not handle potential errors that may occur during the cURL request (e.g., network errors or invalid response format). Adding additional error handling would make the script more robust.

3. **Overall Comments**:

- Both scripts demonstrate good practices such as using appropriate libraries (PDO, cURL), handling errors gracefully, and separating concerns (e.g., database connection script vs. API endpoint script).
- The use of PDO for database interactions provides security against SQL injection attacks and supports multiple database types.
- The implementation could benefit from additional error handling, especially in the API endpoint script, to handle various failure scenarios and provide better feedback to users or other systems consuming the API.

In summary, the provided implementation shows a good foundation for interacting with a PostgreSQL database and consuming data from an API endpoint. However, adding more robust error handling and potentially improving code organization could further enhance its reliability and maintainability.
